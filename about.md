# About

This is a little practicing project,which is my first try on SpriteKit.
The game is mainly based on **Danqing Liu**'s open source project(you can find it [here](https://github.com/danqing/2048)).

## Pending Improvements
~~The stauts saving methods are still a little buggy,and I am working on it.~~
Bug fixed! Now when you restart the game,it begins from where you last quit.

Any contributions or pulls are highly welcome,if you find it intersting,of course.
